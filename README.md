Milling's Final Project

//The site's goal is to create a website that offers interesting and informative information in a concise manner about the Harry Potter books and the other entities that have branched off from the book.  The site does not give a J.K. Rowling biography nor does it go into great detail about the plots of the book.  At times, I will give my own personal opinion about the subject matter.  The site is categorized into three section (Harry Potter Books, Movies, and then other entities).

//The break points happen when the window goes from size 700px to 1000px. 

//

//Each Page's title is a div that runs a css animation on a continuous loop.

//When ever the mouse hovers on an image, the image is enlarged by 1.5

//The main page has a background image that is repeated throughout the page

//On the main page, there is a button to unbold the text.  There is also a second button that can re-bold the text.
