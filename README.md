Milling's Final Project

The site's goal is to create a website that offers interesting and informative information in a concise manner about the Harry Potter books and the other entities that have branched off from the book.  The site does not give a J.K. Rowling biography nor does it go into great detail about the plots of the book.  At times, I will give my own personal opinion about the subject matter.  The site is categorized into three section (Harry Potter Books, Movies, and then other entities).

The break points happen when the window goes from size 700px to 1000px. The Tablet size has rows of two while the desktop size has rows of three.

All the pages have a three-up column layout (header, main, footer)

Each Page's title is a div that runs a css animation on a continuous loop.

When ever the mouse hovers on an image, the image is enlarged by 1.5

The main page has a background image that is repeated throughout the page

On the main page, there is a button to unbold the text.  There is also a second button that can re-bold the text.

Note: The HTML Validator says there is a problem for all my <script> code, but your coworker and I could not find the problem.  The javascript works as well.
